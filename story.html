    <h1>Athul </h1>
    <p>
        Once upon a time in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills and thick forests, there was a boy named
        <strong>Athul</strong>. He was known throughout the village for his boundless energy, sharp mind, and a sense of
        adventure that
        was unmatched. While other kids spent their afternoons playing games or reading books, Athul loved to explore
        the unknown, always on the lookout for new mysteries to solve.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        <strong> Athul </strong> was a boy of many interests, each hobby reflecting a different side of his personality.
        He loved spending
        his weekends hiking through the nearby forests, always looking for new trails to explore and fresh challenges to
        overcome. His curiosity didn’t stop there—he had a passion for photography, capturing the beauty of nature with
        his camera, from the delicate wings of butterflies to the sprawling landscape at sunset. When he wasn’t
        outdoors, Athul enjoyed reading adventure novels, immersing himself in worlds of heroes, mysteries, and faraway
        lands. His love for creativity also extended to sketching, and his notebooks were filled with drawings of maps,
        creatures, and inventions that he dreamed of bringing to life.
